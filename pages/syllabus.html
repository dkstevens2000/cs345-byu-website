            <h4>Computer Programming Assignments</h4>
            <p>
                CS 345 programming assignments consist of six labs that build upon each other and are designed to 
                emphasize topics and objectives discussed in class.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Lab 1: Shell</b> - Write a Shell (Command Language Interpreter) to parse textual commands entered 
                    from the userâ€™s keyboard, malloc argument variables, handle signals, and execute programs directly or 
                    as child processes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Lab 2: Scheduler</b> - Write a five-state task scheduler capable of executing up to 128 tasks in a 
                    preemptive, prioritized, round-robin manner.  Implement binary and counting semaphores and schedule 
                    your shell as its first task with pseudo-interrupt driven character input.  Add timer semaphores and 
                    tasks to validate your implementation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Lab 3: Jurassic Park</b> - Jurassic Park is an inter-process communication and synchronization 
                    problem between multiple tasks.  Visitors to the park purchase a ticket, wait to take a ride on a 
                    park tour car to see the dinosaurs, and then visit the museum and gift shops before leaving the park.  
                    Since the park is on a limited budget, drivers must perform double duty when not sleeping by selling 
                    tickets and driving the tour cars.  Visitors, drivers, and cars are represented by concurrent tasks 
                    while an additional task is used to display the park status every second.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Lab 4: Virtual Memory</b> - Add a Memory Management Unit to your OS that translates virtual 
                    addresses to physical addresses in a restricted memory space such that 16 LC-3 crawler and/or 
                    memory test programs execute concurrently in 2 frames of physical memory (128 words).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Lab 5: FSS Scheduling</b> - Add a Fair Share Scheduler (FFS) to your OS scheduler to maximize 
                    overall CPU utilization while also maximizing interactive performance.  Instead of using run queues, 
                    implement a "fair" timeline of future task execution.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Lab 6: FAT</b> - Add a MS-DOS&reg; FAT-12 file manager to your OS that is able to traverse file 
                    directories, view file data, and load/execute LC-3 programs from files.  In addition, use system 
                    buffering, file descriptors, and file pointers to modify file allocation tables (FAT), directory 
                    structures and cluster chains.
                </li>
            </ul>
 

            <p>Please pay careful attention to the following programming guidelines:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Programming labs are found under the "Projects" tab on the on the CS 345 Website (http://students.cs.byu.edu/~cs345ta/).</li>
                <li>Labs are to be passed off on-line with personal laptops (via Zoom?).</li>
                <li>
                    Labs completed and passed off with a "Date Modified" timestamp dated on or before the due 
                    date receive full credit.  Timestamps cannot be used for extra credit points and no older than one week.
                </li>
                <li>Portions of labs submitted after the due date will receive 50% credit.</li>
                <li>
                    As an incentive to get your labs done on-time, assignments completed and passed off at 
                    <span class="important">least one day before the due date</span> (timestamps do not count) 
                    will receive an extra credit point (10%).
                </li>
                <li>All six programming assignments must be completed (functional) to receive an 'A' grade.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h4>Programming Environments</h4>
            <p>
                The choice of the software tools and programming environment is left up to the studentâ€™s discretion.  
                The C programming language will be used for the programming assignments.
            </p>
             
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h4>Homework / Reading Quizzes</h4>
            <p>
                Homework and reading quizzes are designed to reinforce class material, help in exam preparation, 
                and to encourage students to stay current with reading assignments.  In-class participation is 
                strongly correlated with a studentâ€™s understanding of the subject matter. Students may be 
                randomly selected to present their homework solutions to the class. 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Links to homework assignments can be found under "Content" tab.</li>
                <li>Homework will be submitted on Learning Suite.</li>
                <li>Any homework submitted after the due date will be worth 50%.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                You are welcome and encouraged to discuss the homework with your classmates and others.  
                However, you are to do and submit your own work.  Submitting someone's work is considered 
                cheating for which you will receive an E grade for the class and be reported to the Honor 
                Code Office.  No grade is worth the consequences of dishonesty!
            </p>              
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h4>Class Presentations</h4>
            <p>
                At the end of the semester, each student is given the opportunity to present a specific OS 
                topic with respect to an assigned contemporary operating system.  Your presentation will be 
                peer graded and should be complete (ie., self-contained, concise, relevant, adequately 
                addressed topic), insightful (ie., researched, thoughtful, shows effort), and presented 
                well (ie., materials, slides, handouts, examples, stage presence, well organized, intro/summary).  
                Your presentation and peer evaluations, along with your source code submission, will be the 
                final exam for the course.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h4>Exams</h4>
            <p>
                Two midterms will be administered during the term via Learning Suite per the course schedule.  
                The course final is your presentation, peer evaluations, and submission of your zipped source 
                code. Post your OS zipped C source code to Learning Suite on or before the end of BYU finals.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h4>Grades</h4>
            <p>
                Your grade will be based on programming assignments (60%), homework (10%), presentation (10%), and exams (20%) as follows:

                <li>Midterm 2 - 10%</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Grades are assigned on the following absolute scale from the composite total of above areas:</p>

            <ul class="grade-list">
                <li>A : 93-100</li>
                <li>A-: 90-92</li>
                <li>B+: 87-89</li>

                <li>E : 0-59</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>To receive an A grade for the course, a student must complete all six programming assignments.</li>
                <li>
                    In addition, any student who completes all six programming assignments (regardless of the late points) 
                    and passes the final exam, will receive at least a passing grade (C-).
                </li>
                <li>The university policies on 'UW' and 'I' grades will strictly be followed.</li>

        <div class="section">
            <h4>Grading Verification and Appeal Policy</h4>
            <p>
                It is the student's responsibility to verify that lab, homework, and exam scores have been correctly 
                recorded in Gradebook before the last day of class.  Please disregard Gradebook's grading system (ie, 
                final grade, maximum points, etc.) until further notice.

        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h4>Academic Honesty</h4>
            <p>
                The Honor Code includes a statement of standards regarding academic honesty.  Academic honesty includes 
                completing your own homework, programming assignments, midterms, and final.  Students should work together 
                to help each other understand material but should always turn in their own work.  Examples of academic 
                dishonesty include sharing code for assignments with other students, turning in someone else's code as 
                your own, sharing exam material with other students, and cheating on an exam.  Any violation of academic 
                honesty standards will result in failing the class.  All violations of academic honesty are documented and 
                reported to the Honor Code office.
            </p>
            <p>
                Posting, downloading, or viewing any classwork on a public repository such as GitHub is considered cheating. 
                This policy applies even after this class ends &mdash; grades can be changed at any time!

            <h4>Preventing Sexual Harassment and Discrimination</h4>
            <p>
                Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits sex discrimination against any participant in an 
                educational program or activity that receives federal funds.  The act is intended to eliminate sex 
                discrimination in education.  Title IX covers discrimination in programs, admissions, activities, and 
                student-to-student sexual harassment.  The BYU policy against sexual harassment extends not only to employees

            <h4>Students with Disabilities</h4>
            <p>
                Brigham Young University is committed to providing a working and learning atmosphere which reasonably 
                accommodates qualified persons with disabilities.  If you have any disability which may impair your ability 
                to complete this course successfully, please contact the Services for Students with Disabilities Office 
                (378-2767).  Reasonable academic accommodations are reviewed for all students who have qualified documented 
                disabilities.  Services are coordinated with the student and instructor by the SSD Office.  If you need 
                assistance or if you feel you have been unlawfully discriminated against on the basis of disability, you 
                may seek resolution through established grievance policy and procedures.  You should contact the Equal 
                Employment Office at 378-5895, D-282 ASB.

            <h4>Disclaimer</h4>
            <p>
                This syllabus is subject to change during the semester in favor of the student as deemed necessary by 
                the instructor.  It is the student's responsibility to stay current with class policies and check the 
                class website, Learning Suite, and their email often during the week.

            <h4>Incomplete Grade</h4>
            <p>
                A grade of incomplete will be given only if you have serious (usually medical) problems that prevent 
                you from completing the course, can produce documentation, and are passing the course with most of it 
                complete. Should you get a grade of incomplete, together with the instructor, you will agree on a plan 
                to complete the course in a reasonable period of time. The scores that you acquired up until the event 
                which prevents you from completing the course will be included in the computation of your grade. Never 
                will an incomplete be given to avoid a bad grade!  NO EXCEPTIONS!.
